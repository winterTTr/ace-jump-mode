;;; INTRODUCTION
;;

;; What's this?
;;
;; It is a minor mode for Emacs, enabling fast/direct cursor-moving in
;; current view.

;; Where does minor mode come from ?
;;
;; I firstly see such kind of moving style is in a vim plugin called
;; EasyMotion. It really attract me a lot. EasyMotion provides a much
;; simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes the out of w or
;; f{char} by highlighting all possible choices and allowing you to
;; press one key to jump directly to the target. So I decide to write
;; one for Emacs.
;;
;; So I must thank to :
;;         Bartlomiej P. for his PreciseJump
;;         Kim Silkebækken for his EasyMotion


;; What's ace-jump-mode ?
;;
;; ace-jump-mode is an fast/direct cursor location minor mode. It will
;; create the N-Branch search tree internal and marks all the possible
;; position with predefined keys in current view. Allowing you to move
;; to the character/word/line almost directly.
;;

;; What is implemented now ?
;;
;; I do not implement everything from EasyMotion. Because I what to
;; make AceJump as simple as possible, and you don’t even need to
;; spend more than 2 minutes to learn how to use it. So now, there is
;; only three sub-mode, which can help you to quick move to a specific
;; character , word and (non-empty) line. Enjoy it~
;;
;; Of course, if you have any cool suggestion, feel free to tell me at
;; anytime. I will put that to top of my TODO list :D
;;

;;; Usage
;;
;; Add the following code to your init file, of course you can select
;; the key which you prefer to.
;; ----------------------------------------------------------
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "which-folder-ace-jump-mode-file-in/")
;; (require 'ace-jump-mode)
;; (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c SPC") 'ace-jump-mode)
;;
;; ;;If you also use viper mode :
;; (define-key viper-vi-global-user-map (kbd "SPC") 'ace-jump-mode)
